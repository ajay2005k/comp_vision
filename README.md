# Fashion MNIST Image Classification using TensorFlow

This repository contains code for training a neural network model using TensorFlow to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset.\n The Fashion MNIST dataset consists of grayscale images of fashion items belonging to 10 different categories.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Matplotlib

You can install the required dependencies using pip:


## Dataset

The Fashion MNIST dataset is used for training and testing the model. It can be directly loaded using TensorFlow's `tf.keras.datasets.fashion_mnist`.

## Code Structure

- `comp_vision.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data loading, preprocessing, model creation, training, and evaluation.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project.

## Usage

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ajay2005k/comp_vision.git
